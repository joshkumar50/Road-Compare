RoadCompare automatically compares two road-condition videos, locates missing or deteriorated infrastructure, explains each finding with visual evidence and rule-based reasoning, and exports a professional audit report. It is designed for engineers: accurate detections using YOLOv8, transparent logic with IoU and SSIM thresholds, and fast, repeatable audits via an asynchronous pipeline. The application runs on cloud infrastructure (FastAPI, RQ, Redis, Postgres, S3) and presents a modern UI for upload, progress, evidence review, map/timeline visualizations, and one-click PDF/CSV/JSON exports.
